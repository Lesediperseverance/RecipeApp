I implied everything I did in part 2, which is great, because I did exceptionally well in Part 2 with few a mistakes. But this is how i was able to work around magic by using the GUI framework's elements, such as buttons, text boxes, labels, and lists, I constructed the user interface (UI) for the program to support the entry and display of recipe details, ingredient information, and other features.I then used text boxes and dropdown menus in the GUI to take the place of the terminal input prompts. I made a form where users may enter information about a dish, including the number of ingredients, the names of the ingredients, the quantities, the units, the calories, and the food groups. Additionally, verify user input to make sure it adheres to the necessary limitations or format.I added a list or grid component to the GUI so that it displays all of the input recipes' names in alphabetical order. Users can choose a recipe from the list or grid to view its specifics or make adjustments. I created a separate panel or window to display the recipe details in a neat and visually appealing format where users make us of labels or text boxes to present the ingredient names, quantities, units, and steps.
